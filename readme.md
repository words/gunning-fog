Formula to detect the grade level of text according to the [gunning fog
index][formula].

See [`syllable`][syllable] for detecting syllables.

## Install

This package is ESM only: Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed
instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install gunning-fog
```

## Use

```js
import {gunningFog} from 'gunning-fog'

// For “The Australian platypus is seemingly a hybrid of a mammal and reptilian
// creature.”
// 1 sentence; 13 words; 4 polysillabic words, of which two are jargon, proper
// nouns, or compound words.
gunningFog({sentence: 1, word: 13, complexPolysillabicWord: 2})
// => 11.353846...
```

## API

This package exports the following identifiers: `gunningFog`.
There is no default export.

### `gunningFog(counts)`

Given an object containing the number of words (`word`), the number of sentences
(`sentence`), and the number of complex (i.e., jargon, proper nouns, compound
words) polysillabic (three or more syllables) words
(`complexPolysillabicWord`) in a document, returns the grade level associated
with the document.
